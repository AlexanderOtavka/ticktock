# TickTock
TickTock is an app that counts down to the upcoming events that you care 
about.  The Endpoints API lives here.

## Installing Requirements
Run `pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt` from the project root to install
all required libraries.

## Running
Run `dev_appserver.py . --log_level debug
--appidentity_email_address 
507970798023-38epm7efjo114took2kjeq9m73cl3c7k@developer.gserviceaccount.com
--appidentity_private_key_path service-account-secret-key.pem`.  You will need
the secret key file, but it's a secret, so keep it secret if I send it to 
you.  Secrecy is paramount!
